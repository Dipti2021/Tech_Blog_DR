 ## Introduction 
A fULL stack app that showcases blogs created by users, allows users to create their account or signup, create, delete and edit their own blogs and comment on another user's account using their username. If the app is sitting idle for __more than 5 minutes__ then the app automatically signs off.

## Design Process
   * Built a full stack app using the MVC paradigm, created our  server-side API, added user authentication, and connected the app to a database and deployed the app on a web  server.
   * Built on the agile development methodologies that we have  used throughout this course.
   * Instead of using the  HTML for the front end, used handlebars for displaying the front end version of the app.
   * All of this information is stored directly in our website for easy access.
   * Used a framework that was both easy-to use, but also responsive and optimize for the user’s experience.
   * Used Heroku web server to host our app and added a third party JAWS DB in order to display the seeded contents from the database.
   * The steps involved in designing mainy dealt with designing the MVC code and using the MYSQL workbench to seed the necessary data. 
   

 ## Layouts and Frameworks used
 1. __Libraries__ - In order to run the app, I installed alot of libraries, namely,
   * npm install sequelize
   * npm install dotenv
   * npm install mysql2
   * npm install express
   * npm install express-handlebars
   * npm install bcrypt
   * npm install express-session
 2. __Frameworks__ : I used the following frameworks to obtain font icons forthe website and ready-to-use front-end components!
   * Font Awesome
   * Bulma
 3. __Database__:I used it in order to create the input and seed it into our web app
 
    * My SQL
 4. __Frontend, Backend and Styling__ : For this app, I skipped the html layout for the front end and used the normal styling techniches that has been used till now
   * Handlebars
   * CSS3
   * JavaScript

_Along with it,I deployed the app through __Heroku__ web host and Configured an additional add on __JAWS DB__ in order to relate the code and database._

 
 ## App Presentation
 The web app created can be run either from the server using __localhost:3001__ or through the heroku link. Once uploaded, the web page runs as shown ih the gif.
